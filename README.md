# React + Vite

## to-do
- [ ] pick handful of gifs to just serve locally
- [ ] test UI in phone (size/scalling, buttons, prompts, conflicts with gestures)
- [ ] remove the double warning for removing a name or adding a pre-existing name
- pushing to platform
    - [ ] handling secret information (just .gitignore?)
    - [ ] which goes to github vs the platform

## Notes to self
content hash, a standard feature in modern web development called Cache Busting.
To make your website load faster, browsers "cache" (save) files like index.js and 
index.css
 locally. The next time you visit the site, the browser uses the local copy instead of downloading it again.
